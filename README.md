# Kirby Re-Creation In Godot

## ✒️ Description

Welcome to my attempt at re-creating Kirby! You'll have to fight through enemies using various means such as inhaling,spitting and taking the powers of enemies. There will be obstacles to get through 
other than the enemies as well, such as pitfalls, spikes etc. The end goal is to simply reach the end of the level. This is still a work in progress but will be completed soon.
